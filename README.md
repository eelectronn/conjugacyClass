# conjugacyClass
Program takes an input of a partition p of some number n, and give all the distinct permutation of n such that when it's written in cycle notation, the length of cycles is some permutation p. The set of all such possible permutation is called conjugacy class.

This program was created to help with research work by Dr. Terry Visentin in Department of Mathematics and Statistics at The University of Winnipeg.
